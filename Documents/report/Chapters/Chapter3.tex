\chapter{Elements of SDLC}

\section{SDLC Methodology}

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for this project followed a hybrid approach, combining the structured framework of the Waterfall model with Agile elements for flexibility. While Waterfall provided sequential stages (requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing), Agile practices like ongoing feedback and peer-reviewed GitHub pull requests (PRs) were integrated. This PR review process allowed team members to assess code, identify issues early, and ensure quality and consistency. This hybrid methodology balanced systematic progression with iterative refinement based on team collaboration and insights.

\end{table}

The status of each risk was monitored continuously throughout the project's duration to ensure timely responses. To facilitate the analysis and mitigation process, the risks were divided between the \textit{Frontend Team} and the \textit{Backend Team}, considering the project's scope and the number of developers involved. In a real-world project at a well-established company, it would be preferable to allocate risks across additional specialized teams, such as the Security Team, DevOps, and Project Management, etc., to ensure a more comprehensive approach to risk management.

    \item Authentication Handling: Manages JWT tokens received from the backend (stored securely, likely in HttpOnly cookies handled by the browser).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Application Layer (Backend API)}
The backend provides the RESTful API, manages business logic, handles user authentication, interacts with the database and blockchain, and integrates with monitoring systems. Technologies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Framework: Django 5 (Python 3).
    \item API: Django Rest Framework (DRF) for creating API endpoints.
    \item Authentication: Handles user registration, login (native, OAuth), JWT generation/validation (`djangorestframework-simplejwt`), and 2FA logic (`django-otp`).
    \item Database Interaction: Uses Django ORM to communicate with the PostgreSQL database.
    \item Blockchain Interaction: May trigger helper scripts (`Web3.py`) to interact with the Ethereum sidechain for storing tournament data.
    \item Logging: Integrates with the ELK stack for centralized logging.
    \item WSGI Server: Typically runs behind Nginx using a WSGI server like Gunicorn (though not explicitly mentioned in README, it's standard for Django deployment).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Data Layer (Persistence)}
The data layer ensures persistent storage of application data using both relational and blockchain technologies. Technologies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Relational Database: PostgreSQL 15 for user accounts, profiles, settings, individual match history, etc.
    \item Blockchain Database: Ethereum sidechain (Geth node running POA) for immutable recording of official tournament outcomes via smart contracts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Infrastructure Layer (Orchestration and Hosting)}
This layer encompasses the tools and services used for deployment, management, and operation of the application stack. Technologies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Containerization: Docker packages each component (frontend, backend, Postgres, Nginx, ELK, Geth) into isolated containers.
    \item Orchestration: Docker-Compose defines the relationships and configurations for running the multi-container application.
    \item Reverse Proxy / Web Server: Nginx manages incoming HTTPS traffic, routes requests to the appropriate backend service, serves static frontend assets, and handles SSL/TLS termination.
    \item Monitoring: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana) provides infrastructure for log aggregation and analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Communication and Networking}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Internal Communication: Services within the Docker network communicate over a private network defined by Docker-Compose.
    \item External Communication: All external client communication occurs over HTTPS (port 443), managed by Nginx.
    \item API Calls: Frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful HTTP requests to the API endpoints.
    \item Blockchain Calls: Backend (or scripts triggered by it) communicates with the Geth node via RPC calls (typically over HTTP or IPC).
\end{itemize}

\section{Non-functional Requirements}
Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes and constraints of the system.

\subsection*{Performance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Responsiveness}: The SPA frontend should provide a smooth user experience with minimal delays during navigation and interaction. Game rendering on the Canvas should be efficient to maintain playable frame rates.
    \item \textbf{Latency}: Network latency for real-time 1v1 games should be minimized, although the current implementation seems focused on client-side rendering with results submitted post-game. API response times should be reasonably fast.
    \item \textbf{Load Handling}: The system (especially Nginx and the Django backend) should be capable of handling a moderate number of concurrent users, scalable via Docker if needed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Security}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authentication}: Secure mechanisms for login (native, 42 OAuth) and session management (JWT over HTTPS, HttpOnly cookies).
    \item \textbf{Authorization}: Proper checks to ensure users can only access their own data and perform actions they are permitted to.
    \item \textbf{Data Protection}: Use of HTTPS (TLS/SSL) for all external communication. Sensitive data in the database should be handled securely (e.g., password hashing via Django). Input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL Injection) provided by Django/DRF.
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure Security}: Containers should run with non-root users. Network policies within Docker can restrict communication between containers.
    \item \textbf{2FA}: Optional TOTP-based 2FA provides an additional security layer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Reliability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Availability}: The application should be available with minimal downtime. Docker and Nginx help manage service availability.
    \item \textbf{Data Integrity}: PostgreSQL ensures relational data integrity. Blockchain provides immutability for tournament records.
    \item \textbf{Fault Tolerance}: Containerized architecture allows individual services to be restarted if they fail. Error handling should be robust in both frontend and backend.
    \item \textbf{Backup and Recovery}: Regular backups of the PostgreSQL database are crucial (mentioned as a mitigation strategy).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Scalability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Component Scaling}: Docker-Compose allows scaling individual services (e.g., adding more backend instances) if necessary, although load balancing setup might need adjustment.
    \item \textbf{Database Scaling}: PostgreSQL offers various scaling options if needed in the future.
    \item \textbf{Stateless Backend}: Using JWT promotes a stateless backend architecture, which generally scales better horizontally.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Maintainability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Modularity}: The project is divided into distinct components (Frontend, Backend, Blockchain, Infrastructure) and containerized services, promoting separation of concerns.
    \item \textbf{Code Quality}: Adherence to coding standards and use of frameworks (Django, Bootstrap) aids maintainability.
    \item \textbf{Configuration Management}: Environment variables (`.env` file) are used for configuration, separating code from configuration.
    \item \textbf{DevOps Automation}: Makefile and Docker-Compose simplify build, deployment, and management tasks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Usability and Accessibility}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Interface}: The UI, built with Bootstrap, should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
    \item \textbf{Responsiveness}: The application should adapt to different screen sizes (desktops primarily, given the game type).
    \item \textbf{Accessibility}: Conscious effort to include features for visually impaired users (high contrast, keyboard navigation) as stated in goals.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}
The implementation phase involved developing the actual code and functionality based on the design specifications. Key aspects included:

    \item \textbf{Frontend Development:} A responsive Single-Page Application (SPA) interface was built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, leveraging Bootstrap 5 for layout and components. Accessibility features like high-contrast themes and keyboard navigation were incorporated. The frontend interacts with the backend API and uses the HTML5 Canvas for rendering the Pong game dynamically.
    \item \textbf{Game Development:} Pong game mechanics were implemented using JavaScript and Canvas, including ball/paddle physics, scoring, and real-time updates (potentially via WebSockets, although not explicitly detailed in prior context). Game modes (1v1, vs AI, 4-player local, Tournament) were developed.
    \item \textbf{Blockchain Integration:} Smart contracts (Solidity) were developed and deployed to a local Ethereum sidechain (Geth) to immutably record tournament results. Backend interaction was handled using Web3.py.
    \item \textbf{User History and Statistics:} A system was integrated to track and display user match history and statistics (wins/losses), stored primarily in PostgreSQL.
    \item \textbf{User Management and Authentication:} Secure user registration, login (Native, 42 OAuth), profile management (display name, avatar), friends list, and TOTP 2FA were implemented. JWTs, managed via secure HttpOnly cookies, were used for session management.
    \item \textbf{DevOps and Deployment:} The entire application (Backend, Frontend, PostgreSQL, Nginx, ELK, Geth node) was containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose. Nginx served as a reverse proxy and static file server. The ELK stack was configured for centralized logging and monitoring.
    \item \textbf{Collaborative Workflow:} GitHub branches were used for parallel development (e.g., backend, frontend, game features). Peer reviews were conducted on Pull Requests before merging to the main branch to maintain code quality.
\end{itemize}

\section{Testing}
The testing phase ensured the application's functionality, security, usability, and adherence to requirements. Key testing types included:
