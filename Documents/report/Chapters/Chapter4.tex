\section{Wireframes and User Journey}

Wireframes provide a visual outline of the project's user interface structure and play a key role in mapping the user journey. They enable early visualization of layout and user interactions, offering insight into user navigation within the system well before the detailed design and coding phases.\\
The following wireframes tell the story of a user's journey through the \textbf{ft\_transcendence} platform, from their first interaction to gameplay and beyond.

\subsection{Beginning the Journey: Registration and Authentication}

When first accessing the application, users are presented with the login page. Here, they have two paths to proceed: they can either log in with existing credentials or register a new account.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Figures/images/new_images/LoginPage.png}
    \caption{Login Page.} % Entry point for users with credential-based authentication and 42 OAuth options
    \label{fig:login-page}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Path 1: Creating a New Account} For new users, the registration process begins by completing a form with their details. The registration page requires a unique username, valid email address, and secure password.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Figures/images/new_images/RegistrationPage.png}
    \caption{Registration Page.} % Form for new users to create accounts with validation for username, email and password
